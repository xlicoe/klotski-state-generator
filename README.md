This is a Klotski state space tutorial for computational ENR 145 at Coe.


### Background info:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotski

Klotski (from Polish: klocki, lit.â€‰'wooden blocks') is a sliding block puzzle. The blocks are sliding inside a frame, and typically, there's a special one to be moved to the designated location.

In this tutorial, we are interested in visualizing the "state space", where all the possible moves are connected to their neighboring moves to show dimensional patterns or structures.

The goal is to provide a quick demo, allowing students in class to output state space coordinates and create a better 3D visualization on their own.
